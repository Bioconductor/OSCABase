\title{Compile workflow chapters}
\usage{
compileWorkflows(dir = ".", fresh = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{String containing the path to the directory of book chapters.
Usually the same as \code{dir} in \code{\link{setupBookChapters}}.}

\item{fresh}{Logical scalar indicating whether or not to delete old caches.}
}
\value{
All workflow chapters are (re)compiled to generate the corresponding \code{*_cache} directories.
\code{NULL} is invisibly returned.
}
\description{
Compile workflows for the book so that \code{\link{extractCached}} calls work correctly in other chapters.
}
\details{
Compilation is performed in an isolated session using \code{\link{r}} from the \pkg{callr} package.
This ensures that settings from one chapter do not affect the next chapter.

The default \code{fresh=TRUE} is recommended for a rigorous recompilation,
but setting it to \code{FALSE} may be more convenient for quick debugging cycles.
