## Motivation

An organism's immune repertoire is defined as the set of T and B cell subtypes that contain genetic diversity in the T cell receptor (TCR) components or immunoglobin chains, respectively.
This diversity is important for ensuring that the adaptive immune system can respond effectively to a wide range of antigens.
We can profile the immune repertoire by simply sequencing the relevant transcripts [@georgiou2014promise;@rosati2017overview], which can be combined with previously mentioned technologies [@zheng2017massively] to achieve single-cell resolution.
This data can then be used to characterize an individual's immune response based on the expansion of T or B cell clones, i.e., multiple cells with the same sequences for each TCR component or immunoglobulin chain.

By itself, single-cell repertoire sequencing data can be readily analyzed using tools from the [ImmCantation suite](https://immcantation.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
In particular, the `r CRANpkg("alakazam")` package provides functions to perform common analyses to quantify clonal diversity, reconstruct lineages, examine amino acid properties, etc.
However, in most experiments, we also obtain standard RNA sequencing data for each cell; the challenge lies in how we can integrate these two datasets together in the same analysis.
This is not entirely trivial as each cell may have zero, one or multiple sequences for any given repertoire component, whereas we only obtain a single expression profile for that cell.

We would like to define a single data structure that captures both the expression profile and repertoire state for each cell.
This ensures synchronization during operations like subsetting (as previously discussed for the `SingleCellExperiment` class) and reduces book-keeping errors throughout the course of an interactive analysis.
We achieve this using the `SplitDataFrame` class from the `r Biocpkg("S4Vectors")` package, which allows us to accommodate repertoire sequencing data into existing Bioconductor classes while retaining compatibility with ImmCantation functions.
We demonstrate on a publicly available 10X Genomics dataset using mouse PBMCs:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
extractCached("tenx-repertoire-pbmc8k", "clustering", "sce.pbmc")
```

```{r}
sce.pbmc
```

## Analyzing the T cell receptor repertoire

### Data processing

First, we obtain the filtered TCR contig annotations for the same set of cells.
Each row of the resulting data frame contains information about a single TCR component sequence in one cell, broken down into the alleles of the V(D)J genes making up that component (`v_gene`, `d_gene`, `j_gene`) where possible. 
The number of reads and UMIs supporting the set of allele assignments for a cell is also shown, though only the UMI count should be used for quantifying expression of a particular TCR sequence.
Each cell is assigned to a clonotype (`raw_clonotype_id`) based on the combination of the $\alpha$-chain (TRA) and $\beta$-chain (TRB) sequences in that cell.

```{r}
library(BiocFileCache)
bfc <- BiocFileCache(ask=FALSE)
tcr.data <- bfcrpath(bfc, file.path(
    "http://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/cell-vdj/3.1.0",
    "vdj_v1_hs_pbmc3/vdj_v1_hs_pbmc3_t_filtered_contig_annotations.csv"))
tcr <- read.csv(tcr.data, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
head(tcr)
```

The challenge in incorporating all of these data structures into a single object lies in the fact that each cell may have zero, one or many TCR/immunoglobulin sequences.
This precludes direct storage of repertoire information in the `colData()` of the `SingleCellExperiment`, which expects a 1:1 mapping from each cell to each repertoire sequence.
Instead, we store the repertoire data as a `SplitDataFrameList` object where each cell corresponds to a variable-row `DataFrame` containing information for zero-to-many sequences.
This is easily done using the `DataFrame()` constructor and the `split()` function, as shown below:

```{r}
tra <- tcr[tcr$chain=="TRA",]
trb <- tcr[tcr$chain=="TRB",]
sce.pbmc$TRA <- split(DataFrame(tra), factor(tra$barcode, sce.pbmc$Barcode))
sce.pbmc$TRB <- split(DataFrame(trb), factor(trb$barcode, sce.pbmc$Barcode))

# Putting cluster information at the top level, for convenience.
sce.pbmc$cluster <- altExp(sce.pbmc)$cluster
```

### Basic diagnostics

We start by generating some basic cell-level diagnostics.
For each cluster, we determine the proportion of cells that have at least one sequence of a TCR component (Figure \@ref(fig:tcr-prop-cluster-all)).
Clusters with large counts are most likely to be T cells, though some background level of TCR expression may be observed in other clusters due to a mixture of clustering uncertainty, ambient contamination, doublet formation and expression in other cell types.

```{r tcr-prop-cluster-all, fig.width=10, fig.wide=TRUE, fig.cap="Proportion of cells in each cluster that express at least one sequence of the TCR $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$-chains."}
ncells <- table(sce.pbmc$cluster)
ncells

tra.counts.any <- table(sce.pbmc$cluster[lengths(sce.pbmc$TRA) > 0])
trb.counts.any <- table(sce.pbmc$cluster[lengths(sce.pbmc$TRB) > 0])
barplot(rbind(TRA=tra.counts.any/ncells, TRB=trb.counts.any/ncells), 
    beside=TRUE)
```

We can refine this to only consider the productive sequences, i.e., contigs that are likely to produce a functional protein (Figure \@ref(fig:tcr-prop-cluster-prod)).
This is achieved by subsetting the `SplitDataFrameList` with a `LogicalList` object, the latter of which specifies the rows of each per-cell `DataFrame` corresponding to productive sequences.

```{r tcr-prop-cluster-prod, fig.wide=TRUE, fig.cap="Proportion of cells in each cluster that express at least one productive sequence of the TCR $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$-chains."}
is.prod.A <- sce.pbmc$TRA[,"productive"]=="True" # LogicalList
has.prod.A <- lengths(sce.pbmc$TRA[is.prod.A]) > 0
tra.counts.prod <- table(sce.pbmc$cluster[has.prod.A])

is.prod.B <- sce.pbmc$TRB[,"productive"]=="True"
has.prod.B <- lengths(sce.pbmc$TRB[is.prod.B]) > 0
trb.counts.prod <- table(sce.pbmc$cluster[has.prod.B])

barplot(rbind(TRA=tra.counts.prod/ncells, TRB=trb.counts.prod/ncells),
    legend=TRUE, beside=TRUE, ylim=c(0, 1.2))
```

In contrast, using a conventional logical or integer vector to subset the `SplitDataFrameList` will subset the cells themselves (rather than the rows for each cell, as shown above).
For example, we can use this approach to count the number of cells in each cluster that have multiple sequences for a component (Figure \@ref(tcr-prop-cluster-multi)).

```{r tcr-prop-cluster-multi, fig.wide=TRUE, fig.cap="Proportion of cells in each cluster that express two or more sequences of the TCR $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$-chains."}
tra.counts.multi <- table(sce.pbmc$cluster[lengths(sce.pbmc$TRA) > 1])
trb.counts.multi <- table(sce.pbmc$cluster[lengths(sce.pbmc$TRB) > 1])
barplot(rbind(TRA=tra.counts.multi/ncells, TRB=trb.counts.multi/ncells), 
    legend=TRUE, beside=TRUE)
```

### Quantifying clonal expansion

Quantification of clonal expansion is the most obvious application of repertoire sequencing data.
Cells with the same T cell clonotype are assumed to target the same antigen, and any increase in the frequency of a clonotype provides evidence for T cell activation and proliferation upon stimulation by the corresponding antigen.
Thus, we can gain some insights into the immune activity of each T cell cluster by counting the number of expanded clonotypes in each cluster, as shown below for the $\alpha$-chain.
(We do not exclude clonotypes containing cells in different clusters, which can arise for various genuine biological reasons, e.g., differences in the microenvironment.) 

```{r, fig.cap="Proportion of cells in each cluster that have multiple clonotypes, based on the TCR $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$-chains."}
clone.id.A <- unlist(unique(sce.pbmc$TRA[,"raw_clonotype_id"]))
expanded.id.A <- setdiff(clone.id.A[duplicated(clone.id.A)], "None")
length(expanded.id.A) # number of expanded clonotypes for TRA

clone.id.B <- unlist(unique(sce.pbmc$TRB[,"raw_clonotype_id"]))
expanded.id.B <- setdiff(clone.id.B[duplicated(clone.id.B)], "None")
length(expanded.id.B) # number of expanded clonotypes for TRB

is.clone.A <- any(sce.pbmc$TRA[,"raw_clonotype_id"] %in% expanded.id.A)
tra.counts.clonal <- table(sce.pbmc$cluster[is.clone.A])
is.clone.B <- any(sce.pbmc$TRB[,"raw_clonotype_id"] %in% expanded.id.B)
trb.counts.clonal <- table(sce.pbmc$cluster[is.clone.B])

barplot(rbind(TRA=tra.counts.clonal/ncells, TRB=trb.counts.clonal/ncells), 
    legend=TRUE, beside=TRUE)
```

We can use this information to determine whether a particular T cell cluster is enriched for expanding clonotypes.
The example below uses Fisher's exact test to identify a significant increase in the proportion of expanded clonotypes in a cluster of putative CD8^+^ T cells compared to another cluster of CD4^+^ T cells (Figure \@ref(fig:expanded-t-clusters)).
This provides some relative measure of the average immune activity of each cluster though, of course, further subclustering may reveal finer subpopulations with more or less activity than the average of the parent cluster.

```{r expanded-t-clusters, fig.wide=TRUE, fig.asp=1, fig.cap="Distribution of log-abundance values for each antibody-derived tag in the PBMC dataset, across all cells in either T cell cluster (top and bottom panels)."}
# Identifying the clusters:
tclust.1 <- "2"
tclust.2 <- "6"

mat <- cbind(Expanded=tra.counts.clonal,
    Unexpanded=tra.counts.any - tra.counts.clonal)[c(tclust.1, tclust.2),]
mat 

stats <- fisher.test(mat)
stats

# Checking the identities of the relevant clusters. Note that 'cluster' is also
# present as a colData entry in 'altExp(sce.pbmc)', which is why the
# 'other_fields="cluster"' argument works correctty.
of.interest <- sce.pbmc$cluster %in% c(tclust.1, tclust.2)

library(scater)
plotExpression(altExp(sce.pbmc)[,of.interest], 
    features=rownames(altExp(sce.pbmc)),
    other_fields="cluster") + facet_wrap(~cluster, ncol=1)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Checking identities of all relevant entities.
stopifnot(all(mat[,2] > 100))
stopifnot(any(mat[,1] > 100))
stopifnot(stats$p.value <= 0.01)

ave.markers <- sumCountsAcrossCells(altExp(sce.pbmc), sce.pbmc$cluster,
    exprs_values="logcounts", average=TRUE)
stopifnot(diff(ave.markers["CD8a", c(tclust.1, tclust.2)]) < -4)
stopifnot(diff(ave.markers["CD4", c(tclust.1, tclust.2)]) > 5)
```

### Quantifying gene expression and properties

We may also be interested in the expression of specific TCR genes, which can provide some insight into the type of antigens being targeted [@shugay2018vdjdb].
We again use Fisher's exact test to test if our two T cell clusters of interest differ in the proportion of TCR sequences containing each gene.
This yields a number of significant differences that may or may not be interesting, I don't know.
As usual, composition effects apply here.

```{r}
# This should DEFINITELY use countGenes().
gene.id.A <- sce.pbmc$TRA[,"v_gene"]
expanded.cluster <- rep(sce.pbmc$cluster, lengths(gene.id.A))
gene.tab.A <- table(unlist(gene.id.A), expanded.cluster)

# Testing for differences between our clusters.
collected <- list()
totals <- colSums(gene.tab.A)
for (i in rownames(gene.tab.A)) {
    mat <- cbind(
        Gene=gene.tab.A[i,],
        Other=totals - gene.tab.A[i,])[c(tclust.1, tclust.2),]
    stats <- fisher.test(mat)
    collected[[i]] <- DataFrame(OR=stats$estimate, p.value=stats$p.value,
        row.names=i)
}

collected <- do.call(rbind, collected)
collected$FDR <- p.adjust(collected$p.value, method="BH")
collected <- collected[order(collected$p.value),]
head(collected)
```

The same philosophy can be applied to detect significant differences in biophysical properties.
I have no idea what to say about this.
I can only assume that gravy refers to hydrophobicity, and not the sauce.
(One 300g can of gravy gives me a quarter of my daily fat, according to Google.
And half my sodium as well. What a bargain!)
And maybe basic TCRs will prefer to bind acidic pepties?
Now we just have to find all those acidic antigens out there - how hard can it be?
What kind of pathogen uses acidic residues, anyway?
Prolines, now that's a sign of class.

```{r}
# TODO: move this somewhere else.
extractDataFrame <- function(splitted, ...) {
    thing <- data.frame(...)
    thing <- thing[rep(seq_len(NROW(thing)), lengths(splitted)),,drop=FALSE]
    cbind(as.data.frame(unlist(splitted)), thing)
}
df.A <- extractDataFrame(sce.pbmc$TRA, cluster=sce.pbmc$cluster)

library(alakazam)
aap <- aminoAcidProperties(df.A, seq="cdr3")
properties <- grep("_AA_", colnames(aap))
head(aap[,properties])

collected <- list()
for (i in properties) {
    prop <- colnames(aap)[i]
    current <- split(aap[,prop], aap$cluster)
    left <- current[[tclust.1]]
    right <- current[[tclust.2]]
    stats <- wilcox.test(left, right)
    collected[[prop]] <- DataFrame(Delta=median(left, na.rm=TRUE) - 
        median(right, na.rm=TRUE), p.value=stats$p.value,
        row.names=prop)
}

collected <- do.call(rbind, collected)
collected
```

## Analyzing the immunoglobulin repertoire

Immunoglobulins are good.

## Multi-sample analyses

A much more interesting analysis is possible when there are multiple samples and treatment conditions, where the aim is to determine which clusters contain T cell clonotypes that expand in response to treatment.
In much the same vein as the analysis in Chapter \@ref(multi-sample-comparisons), we can obtain a cluster-by-sample count matrix by simply `cbind()`ing together the `tra.counts.clonal` vector from each sample.
To demonstrate, we will pretend that our cells are derived from 4 samples that have been merged together for common clustering (Chapter \@ref(integrating-datasets)).

```{r}
pretend.samples <- sample(letters[1:4], ncol(sce.pbmc), replace=TRUE)

# Creating a count matrix.
clone.counts <- any.counts <- list()
for (i in sort(unique(pretend.samples))) {
    current.sample <- sce.pbmc[,i==pretend.samples]
    clone.id.A <- unlist(unique(current.sample$TRA[,"raw_clonotype_id"]))
    expanded.id.A <- setdiff(clone.id.A[duplicated(clone.id.A)], "None")
    is.clone.A <- any(current.sample$TRA[,"raw_clonotype_id"] %in% expanded.id.A)
    clone.counts[[i]] <- table(current.sample$cluster[is.clone.A])
    any.counts[[i]] <- table(current.sample$cluster[lengths(current.sample$TRA) > 0])
}

clone.counts <- do.call(cbind, clone.counts)
any.counts <- do.call(cbind, any.counts)
```

We then test for condition-specific differences in the proportion of clonotypes that are expanded.
A natural approach would be to apply a beta-binomial model to each cluster, using the expanded and TCR-containing counts as input; for the time being, though, we will just perform a simple Wilcoxon ranked sum test.
We test on proportions to accommodate biological differences in T cell abundance between samples well as technical differences in, say, sequencing depth that might affect the success rate of TCR calls on a sample-by-sample basis.

```{r}
prop <- clone.counts/any.counts

# Pretending that the first two samples are cases,
# and the second two samples are controls.
wilcox.test(prop[tclust.1,1:2], prop[tclust.1,3:4])
wilcox.test(prop[tclust.2,1:2], prop[tclust.2,3:4])
```
