## Motivation

Cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) is a technique that quantifies both gene expression and the abundance of selected surface proteins in each cell simultaneously [@stoeckius2017simultaneous].
In this approach, cells are first labelled with antibodies that have been conjugated with synthetic RNA tags.
A cell with a higher abundance of a target protein will be bound by more antibodies, resulting in more of the corresponding tags.
Both the tags and endogenous transcripts are reverse transcribed and captured in a cDNA library; the abundance of each protein or expression of each gene is subsequently quantified by sequencing of each set of features.
This provides a powerful tool for interrogating aspects of the proteome (such as post-translational modifications) and other cellular features that would normally be invisible to transcript-based studies.

How should the data for these antibody tags be incorporated into the analysis?
While we have counts for both tags and transcripts, there are fundamental differences in nature of the data that make it difficult to treat the former as additional features in the latter.
Most experiments involve only a small number of antibodies (<20) that are chosen by the researcher because they are of _a priori_ interest, in contrast to gene expression data that captures the entire transcriptome regardless of the study.
The coverage of the tags is also much deeper as they are sequenced separately from the transcripts, allowing the sequencing resources to be concentrated into a smaller number of features.
And, of course, the use of antibodies against protein targets involves consideration of separate biases compared to those observed for transcripts.

In this chapter, we will describe some strategies for integrated analysis of antibody tag and transcript data in CITE-seq experiments.
We will demonstrate using a PBMC dataset from 10X Genomics that contains quantified abundances for a number of interesting surface proteins.

```{r}
# Caching it locally with BiocFileCache to avoid repeating it.
library(BiocFileCache)
bfc <- BiocFileCache(ask=FALSE)
stuff <- bfcrpath(bfc, file.path("http://cf.10xgenomics.com",
    "samples/cell-exp/3.0.0/pbmc_10k_protein_v3",
    "pbmc_10k_protein_v3_filtered_feature_bc_matrix.tar.gz"))
untar(stuff, exdir=tempdir())

# Loading it in as a SingleCellExperiment object.
library(DropletUtils)
sce <- read10xCounts(file.path(tempdir(), "filtered_feature_bc_matrix"))
sce
```

## Preprocessing 

### Setting up the data

The `SingleCellExperiment` class has an "alternative Experiment" concept to store data for different sets of features but the same cells.
This is achieved by storing another `SummarizedExperiment` (or an instance of its subclass) _inside_ our `SingleCellExperiment` where the rows can differ but the columns are the same.
In previous chapters, we were using the alternative Experiments to store spike-in data, but here we will use the concept to split off the antibody tag data.
This isolates the two sets of features to ensure that analyses on one set do not inadvertently use data from the other set, and vice versa.

```{r}
sce <- splitAltExps(sce, rowData(sce)$Type)
altExpNames(sce)
altExp(sce) # Can be used like any other SingleCellExperiment. 
```

At this point, it is also helpful to coerce the sparse matrix for antibody tags into a dense matrix.
The tag counts are usually not sparse so storage as a sparse matrix provides no advantage; in fact, it actually increases memory usage and computational time as the indices of non-zero entries must be unnecessarily stored and processed.

```{r}
counts(altExp(sce)) <- as.matrix(counts(altExp(sce)))
counts(altExp(sce))[,1:10] # sneak peek
```

### Quality control

For most part, we can depend on QC on the endogenous transcripts to remove empty droplets and low-quality cells.
Any failure in cDNA capture for a particular cell will affect the coverage of both transcripts and tags, and changes in mitochondrial RNA content are only reflected in the transcriptomic data; as a result, the tags provide little additional information for QC.
For this dataset, the count matrix has already been filtered in _CellRanger_ to remove empty droplets so we only filter on the mitochondrial proportions to remove putative low-quality cells.

```{r}
library(scater)
mito <- grep("^MT-", rowData(sce)$Symbol)
df <- perCellQCMetrics(sce, subsets=list(Mito=mito))
mito.discard <- isOutlier(df$subsets_Mito_percent, type="higher")
summary(mito.discard)
```

If we want to combine transcript and tag data, it is prudent to ensure that we only retain cells that actually have tag counts.
Recall that droplet-based libraries will contain contamination from ambient solution (Section \@ref(qc-droplets)), in this case containing containing conjugated antibodies that are either free in solution or bound to cell fragments.
As the tags are (relatively) deeply sequenced, we can expect non-zero counts for most tags in each cell (Figure \@ref(fig:detected-ab-hist); if this is not the case, we may suspect some failure of antibody tag processing for that cell.
We thus remove cells that have unusually low numbers of detected tags, defined here as half of the median across all cells.
(We could also use `isOutlier()`, but the MAD is zero in this case and filtering would discard useful cells with almost all tags detected.)

```{r detected-ab-hist, fig.cap="Distribution of the number of detected tags across all cells in the PBMC dataset."}
ab.detected <- df$`altexps_Antibody Capture_detected`
med.detected <- median(ab.detected)
threshold <- med.detected/2
ab.discard <- ab.detected < threshold
summary(ab.discard)

hist(ab.detected, col='grey', xlab="Number of detected tags")
abline(v=threshold, col="red", lty=2)
```

By comparison, the total tag count is less useful as a QC metric because it is heavily correlated with the biological state of the cell.
The presence of a targeted protein can lead to a several-fold increase in the total tag count given the binary nature of most surface protein markers.
Removing cells with low total tags would strongly penalize cell types that do not exhibit many (or any) of the selected protein targets, and would represent an extreme case of the issues discussed in Section \@ref(outlier-assumptions).

Finally, to remove the low-quality cells, we subset the `SingleCellExperiment` as previously described.
This automatically applies the filtering to both the transcript and tag data; such coordination is one of the advantages of storing both datasets in a single object.

```{r}
discard <- ab.discard | mito.discard
sce <- sce[,!discard]
```

## Normalization

Counts for the antibody tags are subject to several biases that must be normalized prior to further analysis.
Capture efficiency varies from cell to cell though the differences in biophysical properties between endogenous transcripts and the (much shorter) antibody tags means that the capture-related biases for the two sets of features are unlikely to be identical.
Composition biases are also much more pronounced in tag data due to binary nature of target protein abundances.
As in Chapter \@ref(normalization), we assume that these are scaling biases and compute tag-specific size factors to remove them.
To this end, we again have several strategies that we can choose from to calculate the size factor for each cell:

1. The simplest approach is to normalize on the total tag counts, effectively the library size for the tags.
This is closely related to the common approach of taking the geometric mean of all counts as the size factors [@stoeckius2017simultaneous], with the only difference being that the total count effectively uses the arithmetic mean instead.
Like in Section \@ref(library-size-normalization), these "tag library size factors" are adequate for clustering but will introduce composition biases that interfere with interpretation of the fold-changes between clusters.

    ```{r}
    sf.lib <- librarySizeFactors(altExp(sce))
    summary(sf.lib)

    # Alternatively using the geometric mean.
    # TODO: move into the DropletUtils package.
    sf.geo <- exp(colMeans(log1p(counts(altExp(sce)))))
    sf.geo <- sf.geo/mean(sf.geo)
    summary(sf.geo)
    ```

2. Ideally, we would like to compute size factors that adjust for the composition biases.
This usually requires an assumption that most tags are not differentially expressed between cell types/states.
At first glance, this appears to be a strong assumption - the target proteins were specifically chosen as they exhibit interesting heterogeneity across the population, meaning that a non-DE majority across tags would be unlikely.
However, we can still make it work by assuming that (i) each cell only expresses a minority of the targeted proteins and (ii) the ambient contamination in each library is the same in terms of the number of molecules captured by each droplet.
We can then compute size factors to equalize the coverage of these contaminating tags, thus eliminating cell-to-cell differences in capture efficiency.
This is loosely based on a similar approach for normalization of ChIP-seq data based on background enrichment [@lun2016csaw].

    If possible, we would prefer to obtain an estimate of the ambient profile from the barcodes that were identified as empty droplets (Section \@ref(qc-droplet)).
    In this case, though, this information has already been discarded from the provided dataset, so we instead use a proxy profile constructed from the average of all cells under the assumption that all cell types are equally likely to contribute to the ambient profile.
    We define size factors using a `r Biocpkg("DESeq")`-like approach based on the median of the ratio of each cell's counts to the ambient profile.

    ```{r}
    library(DelayedMatrixStats)
    # TODO: move into the DropletUtils package.
    ambient <- rowMeans(counts(altExp(sce)))
    sf.amb <- colMedians(counts(altExp(sce))/ambient)
    sf.amb <- sf.amb/mean(sf.amb)
    summary(sf.amb)
    ```

    In one subpopulation, the DESeq-like size factors are consistently larger than the tag library size factors, whereas the opposite is true for most of the other subpopulations (Figure \@ref(fig:comp-bias-norm)).
    This is consistent with the presence of composition biases due to differential abundance of the targeted proteins between subpopulations.
    Here, composition biases would introduce a spurious 2-fold change in normalized tag abundance if the library size factors were used.

    ```{r comp-bias-norm, fig.cap="DESeq-like size factors for each cell in the PBMC dataset, compared to tag library size factors. Each point is a cell and is colored according to the cluster identity defined from normalized tag data."}
    # Coloring by cluster to highlight the composition biases.
    # We set k=20 to get fewer, broader clusters for a clearer picture.
    library(scran)
    tagdata <- logNormCounts(altExp(sce)) # library size factors by default.
    g <- buildSNNGraph(tagdata, k=20, d=NA) # no need for PCA, see below.
    clusters <- igraph::cluster_walktrap(g)$membership

    plot(sf.lib, sf.amb, log="xy", col=clusters, 
        xlab="Library size factors (tag)",
        ylab="DESeq-like size factors (tag)")
    abline(0, 1, col="grey", lty=2)
    ```

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
    # Checking my trash talk.
    by.clust <- split(log2(sf.lib/sf.amb), clusters)
    med.clust <- vapply(by.clust, median, 0)
    stopifnot(diff(range(med.clust)) > 1)
    ```

3. Some experiments will include antibodies such as isotype controls which maintain similar properties to a primary antibody but lack a specific target. In our example dataset, the three immunoglobulin "IgG" readouts are isotype controls derived from mice.
As with spike-in normalization (Section \@ref(spike-norm)), we could make the assumption that these control tags should not be differentially expressed between cells. 
Any difference thus represents some bias that should be normalized by defining control-based size factors from the sum of counts over all control tags.
We demonstrate this approach below by using the immunoglobulins as control proteins, calculating size factors based on their abundance.

    ```{r}
    controls <- grep("^Ig", rownames(altExp(sce)))
    sf.control <- librarySizeFactors(altExp(sce), subset_row=controls) 
    ```

    This approach exchanges the previous non-DE assumption for another strong assumption about the lack of DE in control proteins, and it is difficult to predict which of these assumptions is more palatable in the general case.
    Another interesting effect is that this approach will eliminate cell-to-cell variation in total protein content whereas the DESeq-like size factors will not (as total protein content does not affect the level of ambient contamination).
    This represents a reversal from the behavior of the analogous normalization strategies for endogenous transcripts, where spike-in normalization preserves differences in total RNA content while deconvolution does not.

We suggest using the DESeq-like size factors by default, as these are the most general and eliminate the major problems with composition biases.
Running `logNormCounts()` will then perform scaling normalization and log-transformation for both the endogenous transcripts and the tags using the separately derived size factors.

```{r}
sizeFactors(altExp(sce)) <- sf.amb
sce <- logNormCounts(sce, use_altexps=TRUE)

# Checking that we have normalized values:
assayNames(sce)
assayNames(altExp(sce))
```

## Proceeding to downstream analysis

Unlike transcript-based counts, feature selection is largely unnecessary for analyzing tag data.
This is because feature selection has already occurred during experimental design, where the manual choice of target proteins means that all tags correspond to interesting features by definition.
From a practical perspective, the tag count matrix is already small so there is no need for data compaction from using HVGs or PCs.
Moreover, each tag is often chosen to capture some orthogonal biological signal, so there is not much extraneous noise in higher dimensions that can be readily removed.
This suggests we should directly apply downstream procedures like clustering and visualization on the log-normalized abundance matrix for the tags (Figure \@ref(fig:tsne-tags)).

```{r tsne-tags, fig.cap="$t$-SNE plot generated from the log-normalized abundance of each tag in the PBMC dataset. Each point is a cell and is labelled according to its assigned cluster."}
# Set d=NA for no PCA.
g <- buildSNNGraph(altExp(sce), d=NA) 
clusters <- igraph::cluster_walktrap(g)$membership

# Generating a t-SNE plot.
set.seed(1010010)
altExp(sce) <- runTSNE(altExp(sce))
altExp(sce)$cluster <- factor(clusters)
plotTSNE(altExp(sce), colour_by="cluster", text_by="cluster", text_col="red")
```

With only a few tags, characterization of each cluster is most efficiently achieved by creating a heatmap of the average log-abundance of each tag (Figure \@ref(fig:heat-tags)).
For this experiment, we can easily identify B cells (CD19^+^), various subsets of T cells (CD3^+^, CD4^+^, CD8^+^), monocytes and macrophages (CD14^+^, CD16^+^), to name a few.
More detailed examination of the distribution of abundances within each cluster is easily performed with `plotExpression()` where strong bimodality may indicate that finer clustering is required to resolve cell subtypes.

```{r heat-tags, fig.cap="Heatmap of the average log-normalized abundance of each tag in each cluster of the PBMC dataset. Colors represent the log~2~-fold change from the grand average across all clusters."}
averaged <- sumCountsAcrossCells(altExp(sce), clusters,
    exprs_values="logcounts", average=TRUE)

library(pheatmap)
pheatmap(averaged - rowMeans(averaged),
    breaks=seq(-3, 3, length.out=101))
```

Of course, this provides little information beyond what we could have obtained from a mass cytometry experiment; the real value of this data lies in the integration of protein abundance with gene expression.

## Integration with gene expression data

### By subclustering

In the simplest approach to integration, we take cells in each of the tag-derived clusters and perform subclustering using the transcript data.
This is an _in silico_ equivalent to an experiment that performs FACS to isolate cell types followed by scRNA-seq for further characterization.
We exploit the fact that the tag abundances are cleaner (larger counts, stronger signal) for more robust identification of broad cell types, and use the gene expression data to identify more subtle changes in the rest of the transcriptome. 
We demonstrate below by looping over all of the tag-derived clusters and subclustering on gene expression:

```{r}
set.seed(101010)
all.sce <- all.markers <- list()
for (i in as.character(unique(clusters))) {
    chosen <- clusters==i
    x <- sce[,chosen]
    x <- logNormCounts(x)

    dec <- modelGeneVar(x)
    top <- getTopHVGs(dec, prop=0.1)
    x <- runPCA(x, subset_row=top, ncomponents=25)

    g.trans <- buildSNNGraph(x, use.dimred="PCA")
    x$cluster <- igraph::cluster_walktrap(g.trans)$membership
    x$cluster <- paste0("SUB_", x$cluster) # avoid confusion with parents.

    all.sce[[i]] <- x
    all.markers[[i]] <- findMarkers(x, x$cluster, direction="up")
}

# Checking out how many subclusters are in each tag-derived cluster.
lengths(all.markers)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
chosen.cluster <- "12"
```

One of the benefits of subclustering is that we can use the annotation on the tag-derived clusters to facilitate annotation of each subcluster.
If we knew that cluster `X` contained T cells from the tag-derived data, there is no need to identify subclusters `X.1`, `X.2`, etc. as T cells from scratch; rather, we can focus on the more subtle (and interesting) differences between the subclusters using `findMarkers()`.
For example, cluster `r chosen.cluster` contains CD8^+^ T cells according to Figure \@ref(fig:heat-tags), in which we further identify internal subclusters based on _GZMH_ activity (Figure \@ref(fig:gzmh-cd8-t)).

```{r gzmh-cd8-t, fig.cap="Distribution of log-normalized expression values of _GZMH_ in transcript-derived subclusters of a tag-derived subpopulation of CD8^+^ T cells."}
of.interest <- "12"
plotExpression(all.sce[[of.interest]], "ENSG00000100450", x="cluster")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
stopifnot(identical(of.interest, chosen.cluster))
stopifnot(averaged["CD3",of.interest] > 10)
stopifnot(averaged["CD8a",of.interest] > 10)
```

Subclustering is also conceptually appealing as it avoids comparing log-fold changes in tag abundances with log-fold changes in gene expression.
This ensures that orthogonal variation (or noise) from the transcript counts does not compromise cell type/state identification from the relatively cleaner tag abundances.
The downside is that relying on previous results increases the risk of misleading conclusions when ambiguities in those results are not considered, as we have previously discussed in Section \@ref(subclustering).
This requires some additional checks to ensure that each subcluster has similar tag abundances, e.g., using a heatmap as in Figure \@ref(fig:heat-tags) or with a series of plots like in Figure \@ref(fig:subcluster-tag-dist).

```{r subcluster-tag-dist, fig.asp=0.5, fig.wide=TRUE, fig.cap="Distribution of log-normalized abundances of all tags in each subcluster of the CD8^+^ T cell population."}
# Plotting the *expression* from the altExp in combination
# with the *cluster* from the main experiment.
plotExpression(altExp(all.sce[[of.interest]]), 
    x=I(all.sce[[of.interest]]$cluster),
    features=c("CD3", "CD8a"))
```
