# Orchestrating Single Cell Analysis

All book-related source code has been moved to the [OSCA-source](https://github.com/OSCA-source) organization.
This repository is retained only as a signpost... and also to provide [a Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/bioconductor/orchestratingsinglecellanalysis). 

The Docker image itself contains all of the packages required to create the full set of OSCA books.
The latest sources of the books themselves are stored in `/home/book/`.
